A simple graphical interface for the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) tool.

The application is packed in a single executable file with no dependencies.

The target OS is currently Windows â‰¥ 10. Though, there's no OS-dependent features or libs used, so you're free to try and build it on Linux.
